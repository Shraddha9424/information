      <li>In Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I are teaching a new course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3ZJ0oITwpM">teletubbies</a>Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and will cover a range of ethical,
        societal,
        and policy implications of computing and information.</li>
